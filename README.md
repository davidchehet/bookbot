# Bookbot
BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!
Input a .txt file, and receive an output of the count of each character in the file. Works with any .txt file, even novels.

The proper way to run is to be in the root directory(bookbot) and this is the format:
python3 main.py <path-to-file>

Enjoy!
